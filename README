== ABOUT ==
TaskMailer is a small ruby application designed to email you status updates 
based on your TaskWarrior to-do lists.  

TaskWarrior is a "command-line todo list manager."  It's a great application 
for organizing and prioritizing tasks. Learn more about it by visiting 
http://taskwarrior.org

== SETUP ==
TaskMailer requires (obviously) TaskWarrior to be installed and running on your
system.  Please visit http://taskwarrior.org for information on how to set up 
and configure an instance of TaskWarrior.

Additionally, TaskMailer requires the Ruote ruby workflow engine (OpenFEru) in
order to schedule email dispatch times.  To set up Ruote, gem install ruote or
visit http://openwferu.rubyforge.org/quickstart.html for more information.
