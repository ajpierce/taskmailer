== ABOUT ==
TaskMailer is a small ruby application designed to email you status updates 
based on your TaskWarrior to-do lists.  

TaskWarrior is a "command-line todo list manager."  It's a great application 
for organizing and prioritizing tasks. Learn more about it by visiting 
http://taskwarrior.org

== PREREQUISITES ==
TaskMailer requires (obviously) TaskWarrior to be installed and running on your
system.  Please visit http://taskwarrior.org for information on how to set up 
and configure an instance of TaskWarrior.

In order to send out emails, TaskMailer requires Pony.  gem install pony or
visit https://github.com/benprew/pony for more information.

Additionally, TaskMailer requires the Ruote ruby workflow engine (OpenFEru) in
order to schedule email dispatch times.  To set up Ruote, gem install ruote or
visit http://openwferu.rubyforge.org/quickstart.html for more information.

Finally, TaskMailer uses Psych to read YAML configuration files.
gem install psych will install Psych, though it may require the libyaml-dev 
library to be installed on your system.
